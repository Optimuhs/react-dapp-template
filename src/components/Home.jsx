        This is a Web 3 DApp (Decentralized Application connected to a
        blockchain protocol) that is meant to simulate a web3 application for
        minting, staking, and earling tokens in a Web3 test environment{" "}

        <h3>This project</h3>
        <p className="ContentText">
          This project isn't planned to be anything other than a tested set of
          smart contracts and a front end that is meant to provide a web
          interface to interact with these deployed contracts. That being said,
          I would name this project: Optimuhs' Thanks! I do not make money from
          this but I thank those who have stopped by and interacted with this
          DApp.

        <h3>Minting</h3>
        <p className="ContentText">
          {" "}
          On this section of the DApp you are able to mint an ERC721 token,
          otherwise known as an NFT, for anything above 0 in Goerli ETH, on the
          Goerli Testnet. If you do not have any Goerli ETH then you can get
          some using the{" "}
          <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/">Alchemy Goerli ETH Faucet</a> or
          any other Goerli Faucet.

        <h3>Staking</h3>
        <p className="ContentText">
          Staking is a process that involves a user, a token, and a smart
          contract designed for staking. When staking, a user locks their token
          into the contract for a period of time and receives a reward token for
          their participation. In this case, this pseudo-staking ecosystem will
          not have a time lock, meaning that users can stake and unstake
          whenever but they must stake a token for 1 day to receive 1 reward
          token.
          <br />
          <br />
          ** Note the reward token and NFT will not have any value and are for
          demonstration, testing, and learning purposes.
